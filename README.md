# TimuOn

TimeuOn is an integrated and centralised time management application for individuals and groups. Every user is either independent or a member of one or more organisations, within which they are assigned roles. The application incorporates meeting arrangement, room scheduling and announcements into standard calendar functionalities. It is an attempt to resolve a prominent issue that arises in modern societies: fast-paced everyday life and an overabundance of commitments render proper time management essential.

This application is being implemented as part of a mandatory project of the Software Engineering course (CEID_NÎ¥232), offered in the academic year 2020-21 by the Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics of the University of Patras in Greece. Thus, the scope of the original idea has been narrowed to a solution catering to Greek tertiary education institutions.
